## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution Project:Hackathon II - Evolution of Todo Phase I:In-Memory Python Console App Core principles:-Spec-Driven Development:All implementations must originate from refined specifications using Claude Code;no manual code writing allowed -Iterative Refinement:Specs must be iteratively improved until Claude Code generates accurate,functional output -Modularity and Extensibility:Design code structures that are modular to facilitate evolution into future phases(e.g.,web app,AI integration) -Simplicity First:Focus on basic functionality while ensuring clean,readable code for an in-memory console application -Reusable Intelligence:Incorporate patterns for subagents and agent skills where applicable to build toward bonus points -No manual coding throughout the project Key standards:-Code Quality:Adhere to PEP8 standards,use meaningful variable names,include docstrings and comments for clarity -Error Handling:Implement robust input validation and graceful error messages(e.g.,invalid task ID handling) -Testing:Include basic unit tests or validation steps in specs to ensure functionality -Documentation:Maintain detailed specs history,CLAUDE.md with all prompts/iterations,and README.md with setup/run instructions -Feature Completeness:Fully implement all Basic Level features(Add Task with title/description,Delete by ID,Update details,View List with status,Mark Complete/Incomplete) Constraints:-Technology Stack:Pure Python 3.13+ with UV;no external dependencies or libraries beyond standard library -Storage:In-memory only(e.g.,lists or dicts);no file or database persistence -Development Environment:Use WSL 2 on Windows;all development in Linux-like setup -No Manual Edits:Code must be generated solely by Claude Code;refinements only through spec updates -Repository Structure:Include constitution.md,specs/ folder with history,src/ with generated code,CLAUDE.md,README.md Success criteria:-Functional Demo:Console app runs interactively,demonstrating all basic features without errors -Process Verification:Specs history
```

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution file for the Hackathon II Todo App project based on the user's specifications. The constitution includes 6 core principles:

1. Spec-Driven Development - All implementations must originate from refined specifications using Claude Code
2. Iterative Refinement - Specifications must be iteratively improved until Claude Code generates accurate output
3. Modularity and Extensibility - Design modular code structures for future phases
4. Simplicity First - Focus on basic functionality with clean, readable code
5. Reusable Intelligence - Incorporate patterns for subagents and agent skills
6. No Manual Coding - All code must be generated by Claude Code

The constitution also includes sections for Key Standards, Constraints, Success Criteria, and Governance, all aligned with the project requirements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created project constitution with 6 core principles and governance structure
- 🧪 Tests: No tests created yet
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with project-specific constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with spec creation and implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures all required principles and constraints

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin specification creation based on constitution
