# Hackathon II - Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
All implementations must originate from refined specifications using Claude Code; no manual code writing allowed. All implementations must be generated through specifications and refined iteratively until Claude Code produces accurate, functional output.

### II. Iterative Refinement
Specifications must be iteratively improved until Claude Code generates accurate, functional output. Continuously refine and enhance specifications to ensure the generated code meets all requirements and quality standards.

### III. Modularity and Extensibility
Design code structures that are modular to facilitate evolution into future phases (e.g., web app, AI integration). Code must be structured in a way that allows for easy extension and adaptation to new requirements and platforms.

### IV. Simplicity First
Focus on basic functionality while ensuring clean, readable code for an in-memory console application. Prioritize simple, clear implementations that fulfill requirements without unnecessary complexity, while maintaining code quality and readability.

### V. Reusable Intelligence
Incorporate patterns for subagents and agent skills where applicable to build toward bonus points. Design systems that can leverage AI capabilities and reusable components to enhance functionality and provide extensibility for future development.

### VI. No Manual Coding
No manual coding throughout the project. All code must be generated by Claude Code through specification refinement, with no hand-written code allowed in the final implementation.

## Key Standards

Code Quality: Adhere to PEP8 standards, use meaningful variable names, include docstrings and comments for clarity. All code must follow Python best practices and maintain high readability standards.

Error Handling: Implement robust input validation and graceful error messages (e.g., invalid task ID handling). All user inputs must be validated and appropriate error messages provided for invalid operations.

Testing: Include basic unit tests or validation steps in specs to ensure functionality. Each feature must have corresponding tests to verify correct operation and error handling.

Documentation: Maintain detailed specs history, CLAUDE.md with all prompts/iterations, and README.md with setup/run instructions. All development artifacts must be properly documented for future reference.

Feature Completeness: Fully implement all Basic Level features (Add Task with title/description, Delete by ID, Update details, View List with status, Mark Complete/Incomplete). All specified features must be fully functional and tested.

## Constraints

Technology Stack: Pure Python 3.13+ with UV; no external dependencies or libraries beyond standard library. The project must work within these technology constraints without adding external packages.

Storage: In-memory only (e.g., lists or dicts); no file or database persistence. All data must be stored in memory during application runtime with no permanent storage mechanism.

Development Environment: Use WSL 2 on Windows; all development in Linux-like setup. The development workflow must be compatible with WSL 2 environment on Windows.

Repository Structure: Include constitution.md, specs/ folder with history, src/ with generated code, CLAUDE.md, README.md. The project must maintain this specific directory and file structure for proper organization.

## Success Criteria

Functional Demo: Console app runs interactively, demonstrating all basic features without errors. The application must be fully functional and demonstrate all required features in an interactive console environment.

Process Verification: Specs history and CLAUDE.md show clear iteration trail for judging. The development process must be fully traceable through specifications and history with clear documentation of all iterations.

Extensibility Check: Code design allows easy addition of intermediate/advanced features in later phases. The architecture must be modular and extensible to support future enhancements.

Bonus Readiness: Includes foundations for reusable intelligence (e.g., modular task management class). The codebase must include reusable components and patterns that support AI integration and intelligent features.

Submission Readiness: Public GitHub repo with all required elements, under 90-second demo video. The project must be properly organized in a public repository with all required components and a demonstration video under 90 seconds.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development activities for the Hackathon II Todo App project. All implementation must comply with the stated principles and constraints. Amendments to this constitution require explicit documentation and approval. All code generation and development activities must adhere to the Spec-Driven Development principle and no manual coding constraint.
